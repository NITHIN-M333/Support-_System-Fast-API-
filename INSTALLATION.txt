# About the Project

## What is this Code?
This project is a **Support Management System API** built using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**. It provides CRUD operations and relationships for managing:
1. **Support Price**: Defines pricing details with fields like amount, name, and description.
2. **Support Purpose**: Represents the purpose of operations, with fields such as name and description.
3. **Support Category**: Categories related to purposes, containing fields like name, description, and active status.

### Key Features:
- **Assign multiple categories to a purpose.**
- **Assign multiple prices to a category.**
- **Relationship management** between support purposes, categories, and prices.
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations and relational queries.

This project is ideal for scenarios where structured relationships and hierarchical data need to be managed efficiently.
